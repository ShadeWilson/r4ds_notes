Notes from R for Data Science, a book by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham, for personal reference.

The book is available for free [here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). 

The description from the website: 

> This book will teach you how to do data science with R: You’ll learn how to get your data into R, 
> get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and model it. In this book, you will
> find a practicum of skills for data science. Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock 
> a lab, you’ll learn how to clean data and draw plots—and many other things besides. These are the skills 
> that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things 
> with R. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to 
> save time. You’ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, 
> visualising, and exploring data.
